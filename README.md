Introduction:
Welcome to weather dashboard.  Ever wonder what temperature is around the world?  Well now here's your chance.  

User Story:
The user will be able to go through the world to view the weather. 

Technological Outline:
HTML, CSS, and a Script sheet were made for the project to begin.  As the HTML was being created the CSS was going along as needed with styling to make the webpage pretty.  Javascript was added into the mix as soon as everything with the other two pages were fixed. An AJAX call was made for the weather API.  Everything was placed together. 

Division of Labor:
I, Megan, soley did all work for this.  

Deployment:
Weather Dashboard deployment will be on webpage through Github. Users will be able to view through webpage listed down below as well. 

Conclusion:
Weather impacts us as humans in our day to day lives.  Viewing the weather daily before heading out to work or school or just out can be helpful when planning what to wear outside.  Getting to hot or to cold isn't a fun experience for anyone and can ruin an entire day.  This weather platform is a good way to see anything you might need to know about weather, temperature, and climate at a glance.
